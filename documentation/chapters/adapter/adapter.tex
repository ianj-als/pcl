\chapter{Adapting to PCL}
Your existing scripts and programs can be used with PCL. A simple Python file is required which contains six functions that inform PCLc about the natures of the component.

Care must be taken when adapting your existing work to PCL pipelines. Threading issues and batch or on-line processing must be considered as the dynamics of your final pipeline may depend on it. Also, any state that may need to accumulate over the lifetime of a PCL component must be handled by the adapter for your programs.
